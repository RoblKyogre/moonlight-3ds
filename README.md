Note: I'm no longer working on this paricular port of moonlight for the 3DS.
Check out [zoeyjodon's port](https://github.com/zoeyjodon/moonlight-N3DS/tree/n3ds-main) for a currently working version instead!

# Moonlight 3DS

Moonlight 3DS is a port of Moonlight Embedded, which is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield.

Moonlight 3DS allows you to stream your full collection of games from your powerful Windows desktop to your 3DS.

## Requirements

* [GFE compatible](http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/) computer with GTX 600/700/900/1000 series GPU (for the PC you're streaming from)
* Geforce Experience 2.1.1 or higher

If your PC isn't supported or you're having performance related issues, try using [sunshine](https://github.com/loki-47-6F-64/sunshine) instead.

## Quick Start

* Grab the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/RoblKyogre/moonlight-3ds/releases) and extract it to the root of your SD Card
* Enter the IP of your GFE server in the `moonlight.conf` file located at `sd:/3ds/moonlight`
* Ensure your GFE server and 3DS are on the same network
* Turn on Shield Streaming in the GFE settings
* Pair Moonlight 3DS with the GFE server
* Accept the pairing confirmation on your PC
* Connect to the GFE Server with Moonlight 3DS
* Play games!

## Configuration

You can configure all of the documented settings in the `moonlight.conf` file located at `sd:/3ds/moonlight`.
